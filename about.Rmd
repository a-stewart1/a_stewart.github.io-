Hello, I am Allison Stewart. I am a Masterâ€™s of Public Health student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I have a background in Anthropology and experience working with various non-profit organizations and public health research in the U.S. and Latin America. 

Currently, I am a research assistant at the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University's Earth Insitute, working on a  child-focused disaster preparedness initiative based in Puerto Rico and North Carolina. 

I am passionate about contributing to public health initiatives and research that improve population health outcomes and reduce health disparities, particularly for populations affected by forced migration and complex emergencies. 

For more information, you can contact me via email or refer to my LinkedIn page.
